Key Features of Naive Bayes Classifiers
The main idea behind the Naive Bayes classifier is to use Bayes’ Theorem to classify data based on the probabilities of different classes given the features of the data. It is used mostly in high-dimensional text classification

The Naive Bayes Classifier is a simple probabilistic classifier and it has very few number of parameters which are used to build the ML models that can predict at a faster speed than other classification algorithms.
It is a probabilistic classifier because it assumes that one feature in the model is independent of existence of another feature. In other words, each feature contributes to the predictions with no relation between each other.
Naïve Bayes Algorithm is used in spam filtration, Sentimental analysis, classifying articles and many more.
