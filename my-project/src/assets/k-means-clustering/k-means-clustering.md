Understanding K-means Clustering
K-means clustering is a technique used to organize data into groups based on their similarity. For example online store uses K-Means to group customers based on purchase frequency and spending creating segments like Budget Shoppers, Frequent Buyers and Big Spenders for personalised marketing.

The algorithm works by first randomly picking some central points called centroids and each data point is then assigned to the closest centroid forming a cluster. After all the points are assigned to a cluster the centroids are updated by finding the average position of the points in each cluster. This process repeats until the centroids stop changing forming clusters. The goal of clustering is to divide the data points into clusters so that similar data points belong to same group.
