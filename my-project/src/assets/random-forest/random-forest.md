Understanding Intuition for Random Forest Algorithm
Random Forest algorithm is a powerful tree learning technique in Machine Learning to make predictions and then we do voting of all the tress to make prediction. They are widely used for classification and regression task.

It is a type of classifier that uses many decision trees to make predictions.
It takes different random parts of the dataset to train each tree and then it combines the results by averaging them. This approach helps improve the accuracy of predictions. Random Forest is based on ensemble learning.
Imagine asking a group of friends for advice on where to go for vacation. Each friend gives their recommendation based on their unique perspective and preferences (decision trees trained on different subsets of data). You then make your final decision by considering the majority opinion or averaging their suggestions (ensemble prediction).
